# .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This file consists of a list of commits that should be ignored for
# `git blame` purposes. This is useful for ignoring commits that only
# changed whitespace / indentation / formatting, but did not change
# the underlying syntax tree.
#
# GitHub will pick this up automatically for blame views:
#   https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view
# To use this file locally, run:
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
# To always use this file by default, run:
#   git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
# To disable this functionality, run:
#   git config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile ""
# Comments are optional, but may provide helpful context.
